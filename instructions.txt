🛠️ How to Install the Extension Locally
Download the extension files
👉 Go to the GitHub link I shared and click the green “Code” button, then select “Download ZIP”.

Extract the ZIP
📂 Right-click the ZIP file you downloaded and choose “Extract All…”.
You’ll get a folder with the extension files inside.

Open Chrome Extensions page
🌐 In Google Chrome, go to:
chrome://extensions/
Turn on Developer Mode
🧩 In the top right corner, toggle “Developer mode” ON.

Load the extension
➕ Click “Load unpacked”
📁 Then select the extracted folder (not the ZIP file — the folder inside it).

You're all set! 🎉
The extension is now installed

Running the extension:

1.
Click the extension on the myhrplus page after making a new taxi request (don't need to fill out anything else on my hr, leave it to the extension)

2.
Click the extension

3.
Fill out the form with your schedule - date (mm/dd/yyyy) and shift(e/n) - easier to make a table in excel with this info, then just copy and paste it to the schedule input in the extension. an example excel document is also attached

e.g this is what the schedule input will look like when copied from an excel table
9/20/2024	e
9/21/2024	e
9/22/2024	e
9/25/2024	n

4.
Fill out the rest of the form in the extension with your wanted info - whatever you'd normally enter into my hr for the fields. i.e nature of service (reason for evening/night shift form input) will change based on your shift. 

5. 
Press start and watch it go. 
Can leave it to run in the background.
If stopped just remove the shift entries you don't want it to redo, and play
