🛠️ How to Install the Extension Locally
Download the extension files
👉 Go to the GitHub link I shared and click the green “Code” button, then select “Download ZIP”.

Extract the ZIP
📂 Right-click the ZIP file you downloaded and choose “Extract All…”.
You’ll get a folder with the extension files inside.

Open Chrome Extensions page
🌐 In Google Chrome, go to:

chrome://extensions/
Turn on Developer Mode
🧩 In the top right corner, toggle “Developer mode” ON.

Load the extension
➕ Click “Load unpacked”
📁 Then select the extracted folder (not the ZIP file — the folder inside it).

You're all set! 🎉
The extension is now installed and will start working automatically during the monitoring hours.
